### **UI & Features**

**UI**
- Curly font is selected as a more informal approach towards users seeing the webpage while the non-curly font is used to present more serious information.
- Light colours are selected as the background for kitchens are mostly bright, with darker colours mostly black as the contrast of the words to hold more weight.
- The main focus is to catch the attention of the user with the showcase of facilities and chefs, so they can either go down to take a look or leave their contacts for staff to follow up.

**Existing features:**  
- Using the navbar, a simple click can help navigate users to the respective categories. 
- There is also a return to top button at the bottom right should user wish to return to the top page easily.
- At the rates page, should user wish to enquire on rates or custom private classes, they can submit their email address for the staff to follow up. A simple enquiry form can be found at the end as well. 

**Features left to implement**
- Chatbot can be added for the staff to communicate easily to users
- Adding more information about the chefs. Clicking the profile of the chef will lead user to a separate page which shows their achievements, awards, as well as some of their finest dishes. 
- A function which allows the user to self customise the classes as well as selection of the cuisines and chefs they wanted, while showcasing the chefs schedules.
- The send button will send the information to a database
